Fast Python bindings for [Assimp](http://assimp.org/), Cython-based, BSD3 license.

It uses the same function names as the original library, so examples from c++ tutorials can be used with minor changes.

It has been tested on:

* Windows 7, 10
* Linux
* Mac
* Python 3.8 - 3.10
* Pypy
---
#### Example usage:

```python
from assimpcy import aiImportFile, aiPostProcessSteps as pp 
flags = pp.aiProcess_JoinIdenticalVertices | pp.aiProcess_Triangulate 
scene = aiImportFile('some_model.3ds', flags)
print('Vertex 0 = {}'.format(scene.mMeshes[0].mVertices[0]))
```

Matrices, quaternions and vectors are returned as Numpy arrays.

---
#### Requirements:

* Numpy >= 1.24.4

(Assimp 5.4.3 is included in the binary wheel)
